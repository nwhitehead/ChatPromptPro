## Protocol

Vue app - JavaScript wants to call OpenAI ChatGPT API to do response to a set of messages. Connects to websocket
endpoint in backend Express server. Server talks to OpenAI endpoint and keeps track of streamed HTTP response.
Replies with multiple ws messages back to Vue client. All communication of messages on ws is with JSON strings.

Requests:
    - tag: chat | stop
    - id: unique identifier for request (to distinguish from other simultaneous reqs on same ws address)
    - data: stuff that OpenAI accepts (e.g. model, messages, temperature, etc.) stream must be true

Responses:
    - tag: update | done
    - id: unique identifier from request
    - data: current piece of text generated (one token I think) | reason for being done (error | length | ...)
